  "summary": "A berry that, when held, calms a Pok\u00e9mon, making it less likely to act when confused. Rarely used in competitive play due to the low prevalence and reliability of confusion as a strategy.",
  "typical_users": "Almost never seen in serious competitive formats; occasionally on gimmick sets or in low-ladder play where confusion-inducing moves like Confuse Ray or Dynamic Punch are used."
